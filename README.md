Forest Fires

1. Dataset: This dataset is public available for research.
2. Sources:
   Created by- Paulo Cortez and An√åbal Morais (Univ. Minho) @ 2007
   The details are described in [Cortez and Morais, 2007]. 
 
3. Relevant Information:

   This is a very difficult regression task. It can be used to test regression methods. Also,
   it could be used to test outlier detection methods, since it is not clear how many outliers
   are there. Yet, the number of examples of fires with a large burned area is very small.

4. Number of Instances: 517 

5. Number of Attributes: 12 + output attribute
  
6. Attribute information:

   1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
   2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
   3. month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec" 
   4. day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
   5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
   6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
   7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
   8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
   9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
   10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
   11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
   12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
   13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 
   (this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
    sense to model with the logarithm transform). 

7. Missing Attribute Values: None
